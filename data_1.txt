Some parents and educators feel that two months is too long a break from school.
I don't agree with them, because during the school year, and, especially, when parents are educated and working, we don't have the opportunity to sit and chat with out kids and that leads to a strong gap between us (parents and kids), we start to lose this connections and that sometimes leads our kids to behave in an aggressive way. Besides when we as parents are working, we do not have enough time to go out with our kids and have fun and build up together this strong relationship, so in the two months vacation I can make up to satisfy my kids about the time we lost or were not together.
I think that summer vacation should be long. 
I as a teacher, believe that we, the teachers, need a break, so will get back to school in September with enough energy. 
Students also need it so they will take a rest from all the studying pressure they go under during the school year.
I completely understand that long vacation is a very serious problem, for parents who work during summer, they have to look for solutions to keep and eye over their children and also to keep them occupied and get the benefits of their time. 
I agree it is problematic situation for parents, still I believe it is healthier to keep this long vacation for the good of students so they will be relieve of the studying pressure. Teachers also need it to keep away of all the demands of their job and responsibilities.
